# Snake-Game
In this repository, there are links, code, circuit diagram and procedure to help you design and develop Snake Game using Arduino Uno.

## Acknowledgement
This project was developed with guidance and references from multiple sources. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Aadarsh UNO, a creator from Hacster.io whose guide and reference materials helped me throughout the process.

## Introduction
This project is a modern take on the classic Snake Game, implemented using an 8√ó8 dot matrix display as the game screen. The player controls the snake‚Äôs movement through a joystick, allowing smooth directional control, while a potentiometer is used to adjust the game‚Äôs speed, adding an extra level of challenge and customization.

At the core of the system is an Arduino UNO, which processes player inputs, updates the game logic, and renders the snake‚Äôs movement on the display. The compact design and intuitive controls make this project a fun and interactive way to combine programming logic, electronics, and real-time game mechanics.

## Requirements
I purchased all my components from Robocraze. It is a trusted online eCommerce for projects such as these. They also provide components at a reasonable price as compared to it's competitors. As such, I will name the components, as well as leave a link.

- Arduino UNO (https://robocraze.com/products/uno-r3-board-compatible-with-arduino)
- 8x8 Dot Matrix Display (https://robocraze.com/products/max7219-8x8-led-dot-matrix-display-module)
- Joystick Module (https://robocraze.com/products/joystick-module)
- 10k Potentiometer (https://robocraze.com/products/10k-pot-potentiometer-with-knob)
- Jumper Wires (https://robocraze.com/products/jumper-wire-set-m2m-m2f-f2f-40-pcs-each)
- Type A to B Cable: (https://robocraze.com/products/usb-a-b-cable-3-0-cm)
  (This cable is required to upload the code from your laptop/PC to Arduino UNO microcontroller.)
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
  (You will need an IDE to upload the code to Arduino microcontroller. So, I have given the link to download it here.)

## Procedure
### Step 1: Procure the Components
- Using the link given above, or by other means, procure the components required for this project.

### Step 2: Upload the Code
- Open Arduino IDE, and paste the code. The code is provided in this repository as code.ino.
- Connect the Arduino UNO to your Laptop.
- Select Port and choose the available Port (Eg. COM3)
- Select Board and select Arduino UNO (If you cannot see any boards, go to Boards Manager and Install Arduino Boards.)
- Next, click on Verify (Optional)
- Click on Upload.

### Step 3: Make Circuit Connections
- By referring to the Circuit Diagram, complete the circuit Connection.

### Step 4: Check the Circuit Connections
- You can never be too careful. Cross verify the circuit diagram and connections, and make sure all of them are connected properly, and no wires are loosely connected.

### Step 5: Play
- The power supply from the laptop should be more than enough to run this project.
